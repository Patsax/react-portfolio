                    <p>My name is Patrick Sachleben. I have worked at my familyâ€™s Dairy Queen for the last 24 or so years. That path just didnâ€™t fulfil me, so I decided to enroll in a bootcamp for full stack development. Iâ€™m just beginning my journey in this exciting field, and I very much look forward to learning and growing my skills.</p>
                    <p>In my spare time I pursue several forms of entertainment. I like most forms of gaming be they video, board, or even card games. I quite like to read with fantasy and sci-fi being my favorite genres. I also enjoy watching movies such as anything Star Wars, Star Trek (the two are not mutually exclusive), Marvel, etc. You might call me a huge nerd. ðŸ˜Š</p>
